I don’t see the questions

Let me ask the questions in a simpler way to clarify the requirements:

## Tool

Bash: {'command': 'echo "I need to clarify a few things about your weekly \'weeks lived\' automation:"', '

I need to ask you a few clarifying questions before I create the implementation plan:

## 1. **Birthday Date**
What's your date of birth for calculating weeks lived? (format: YYYY-MM-DD, e.g., 1990-05-15)

## 2. **Image Style**
What kind of image visualization do you want for the weekly notification?
- **Option A**: "Life in Weeks" grid (52 columns × ~90 rows, filled squares = weeks lived)
- **Option B**: Simple counter card/badge showing the week number prominently
- **Option C**: Progress bar showing percentage of life lived with week count

## 3. **Reply Destination**
When you reply to the weekly image, where should your response be saved?
- **Option A**: Today's daily note (`Daily/YYYYMMDD.md`)
- **Option B**: Weekly note (`YYYY-W##.md`)
- **Option C**: Dedicated journal file (e.g., `Journal/weekly-reflections.md`)
- **Option D**: Make it configurable in settings (can choose/change later)

## 4. **Schedule**
When should the weekly notification be sent?
- **Option A**: Monday at 9:00 AM (start of week reflection)
- **Option B**: Sunday at 19:00 (end of week reflection)
- **Option C**: Saturday at 10:00 AM (weekend reflection)
- **Option D**: Custom time (please specify)

## 5. **Plugin Settings**
You mentioned "plugins should be able to add settings" - can you clarify what you mean? Are you referring to:
- Making the weeks-lived feature a plugin itself with configurable settings?
- Allowing other plugins (like Claude Code plugin) to add their own configuration options to a settings UI?

Please answer these questions and I'll design a comprehensive implementation plan!
