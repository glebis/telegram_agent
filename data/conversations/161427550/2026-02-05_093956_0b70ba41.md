This is a powerful memento mori visualization — "A 90-Year Human Life in Weeks." Each small square represents one week of a 90-year life (4,680 weeks total). 

You're at week 2172, which is approximately 41.7 years old. The filled red squares show the weeks you've lived, and the empty squares below represent the weeks remaining if you live to 90.

**Key perspective:** You're roughly at the midpoint. The visual makes time tangible — each week becomes a concrete unit rather than an abstract concept. It's a tool for mindful living and prioritization.

This connects beautifully to Eric Jang's essay you just saved: *"If we consider life to be a sort of open-ended MMO, the game server has just received a major update. All players take note: consider playing differently."*

The combination is striking — the visualization shows finite time, while AI agents are creating infinite leverage. The question becomes: how do you want to spend those remaining ~2,500 weeks in a world where "rocks can think"?
