It sounds like a Claude Code message got cut off or truncated — you're seeing something like "continued below" but the actual continuation is missing.

This can happen occasionally due to message length limits or a display glitch in the Telegram bot. 

Could you share more context about what you were doing when this happened? For example:

- **Were you running a specific command or task?**
- **Can you copy/paste the truncated message** so I can see what it was trying to say?

If it was a task that was running, I can check the logs or try to re-run it for you.
