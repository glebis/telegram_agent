    skills:
      - name: "visual_hierarchy"
        prompt: |
          Apply visual hierarchy principles:
          - Use size, weight, and color to establish importance
          - Create clear focal points and visual flow
          - Maintain consistent spacing and alignment
          - Use whitespace purposefully

      - name: "typography"
        prompt: |
          Follow typography best practices:
          - Use max 2-3 font families
          - Maintain readable font sizes (16px+ for body text)
          - Use appropriate line heights (1.5-1.8 for body text)
          - Create clear type hierarchy with size/weight
          - Ensure sufficient contrast (WCAG AA minimum)

      - name: "color_palette"
        prompt: |
          Apply color theory and accessibility:
          - Use a limited, cohesive color palette
          - Ensure WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for text)
          - Consider color blindness accessibility
          - Use color purposefully, not decoratively
          - Maintain brand consistency

      - name: "spacing_rhythm"
        prompt: |
          Create consistent spacing rhythm:
          - Use a spacing scale (e.g., 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px)
          - Maintain consistent padding and margins
          - Group related elements with proximity
          - Separate sections with adequate whitespace

  # UI Skills - Opinionated constraints for better interfaces

    description: "Checklist to prevent common yet undesirable UI patterns"
    priority: high
    apply_to:
      - forms
      - navigation
      - buttons
      - modals
      - cards

    constraints:
      - name: "avoid_disabled_buttons"
        rule: "Don't disable buttons - use validation messages instead"
        rationale: "Disabled buttons provide no feedback on why they're disabled"

      - name: "meaningful_labels"
        rule: "Use descriptive button labels, not generic 'Submit' or 'OK'"
        rationale: "Users should know what action they're taking"

      - name: "inline_validation"
        rule: "Validate form fields on blur, not just on submit"
        rationale: "Early feedback prevents frustration"

      - name: "loading_states"
        rule: "Always show loading states for async operations"
        rationale: "Users need feedback that their action was received"

      - name: "error_recovery"
        rule: "Provide clear error messages with recovery steps"
        rationale: "Users need to know what went wrong and how to fix it"

      - name: "mobile_first"
        rule: "Design for mobile first, enhance for desktop"
        rationale: "Ensures usability on smallest screens"

      - name: "touch_targets"
        rule: "Minimum 44x44px touch targets for interactive elements"
        rationale: "Ensures accessibility and usability on touch devices"

      - name: "focus_indicators"
        rule: "Always show visible focus indicators for keyboard navigation"
        rationale: "Critical for keyboard and screen reader users"
